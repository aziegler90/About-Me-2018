<h2 class="darkorchid">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi guys! My name is Amber Z. and I'm from Phoenix, AZ. That's right folks...
I'm A.Z. from AZ. I currently work at the UNF ITS Help Desk. I am a supervisor
who manages the schedule and also provides guidance on how to troubleshoot user
issues. I enjoy being a student and staff employee here at UNF. The hours are
flexible with my classes, and the benefits are great.</p>
<p>Before working at the Help Desk I was in the Navy for six years. My job title
was Information Systems Technician Second Class. I basically worked on radio
equipment and was a system administrator for the network on my ship. I was stationed
in Mayport where I met my husband and ultimately ended up here in Jacksonville. It's
crazy to say, but I do miss the deployments because it simplified my life. My husband
and I plan to move to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas" target="_blank" class="big">Las Vegas</a>
after I graduate so that we can be closer to my family. We're hopeful that there will
be more opportunity for jobs and social events in Sin City.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="darkmagenta">Hobbies &amp Interests</h2>
<p>I am a workaholic so although I have hobbies I don't have a lot of time to
enjoy them. I like to play video games. I got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas
so I've been really into playing that. The only games I have are Legend of Zelda:
Breath of the Wild, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Before that I was really into
Red Dead Redemption 2 on XBOX One.</p>
<p>I enjoy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music" target="_blank" class="big">Electronic Dance Music</a>
scene and I enjoy going to music festivals. I also love listening different EDM
music producers and finding new music. If I made more money I would go to music
festivals all year round. But I don't, so instead I play with my dog. I have an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog" target="_blank" class="big">English bulldog</a>
named Z. He's four years old and still acts like a puppy. I wouldn't call hanging
out with my dog a hobby because he's always around every day.</p>
<br>

<h2 class="indigo">Education</h2>
<p>I am currently a Senior here at UNF. I am working on my Bachelors in Information
Technology. I have been technically working on my Bachelors degree since 2008. I went
to South Mountain Community College in Phoenix, AZ for my freshman year. While I was
in the military I took classes at Olympic College in Bremerton, WA. After separating from
the military I put school as one of my top priorities. I got my General A.A. at FSCJ, and
now I'm finally finishing up this year with my Bachelors. It's been a long journey, but
I'm glad I'm able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>While I haven't consistently been in school these past ten years, I have always had
a subject to learn. Working in IT in the Navy gives you plenty of opportunities to
study different IT fields. I went to classes that would last anywhere from a day to a
couple weeks and studied different operating systems and network infrastructures.
I was able to learn about cybersecurity and use different kinds of software to help
keep our networks secure. I also was able to get a few certifications in the process.
Below are the certifications and degrees I have earned so far.</p>
